SFT installation notes:
------------------------

-> edit config.ini in /opt/smscg/sft/etc
-> add and populate  /etc/vomses on host
-> add it to init.d (either update-rc.d, or chkconf)

Writing your own site functional test
-------------------------------------

SFTs are created/added via the GridMonitor interface: 
https://<YOUR_MONITOR_HOST>/monadmin/sft

Your XRSL of the SFTs can denote logical errors in the execution
of the test by two ways:

Option 1.) is to specify 'test.error' file for your job/test, which shall
be named 'error.log'.

...
(stderr='error.log')
...

Option 2.) is to have gmlog poinitng to '.arc'  or 'log' e.g.

...
(gmlog='.arc')
...

Please stick to the conventions as it's the only way for the SFT script
to intercept logical errors.
