SFT installation notes:
------------
-> edit config.ini in /opt/smscg/sft/etc
-> for first installation, you need to create db. run script in /opt/smscg/sft/etc/db_setup.py manually (???)
-> add and populate  /etc/vomses on host
-> add it to init.d (either update-rc.d, or chkconf)


Todos:
-----

-> don't test host/sites with scheduled downtimes
-> periodically re-read sft configuration
